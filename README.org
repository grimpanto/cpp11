* C++11

I have written this little book about C++ mainly for teaching purposes. The
beginnings of this work date back more than 10 years ago. So, it's not up to
date with the current C++ standards, but anyway, it's still usable in
one way or another.

Here, you will find the built [[build/prod_book.pdf][prod_book.pdf]] and the corresponding examples
in the following directory [[exammples][examples]].
